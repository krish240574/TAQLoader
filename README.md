# TAQLoader
NYSE TAQ Loader, using multi-partitioned dbs
This is inspired from the following:
  - https://aquaq.co.uk/torq-taq-a-nyse-taq-loader/ - For integration into TorQ
  - https://code.kx.com/q/wp/multi-partitioned-dbs/#striping-data-over-multiple-partitions-per-date - brilliant idea, for TAQ data
  - https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-kdb.html - sweet code, for loading large files using named pipes.
